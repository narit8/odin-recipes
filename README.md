# odin-recipes
This website is designed to function as a recipe book. It contains tried-and-true recipes, one's that I am workshopping, and recipe inspiration. This is an assigned project from The Odin Project's 'Foundations' course. This project demonstrates skills in:
1. Git basics (cloning, staging, commitning)
2. Well written commit messages
3. HTML tags, attributes, and boiletplate

This page will be updated with a self-reflection once the project is complete.
