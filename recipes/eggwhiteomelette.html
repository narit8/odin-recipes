      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>I make this omelette every day for lunch. Usually, I fill it with veggies and 
          a little bit of crumbled goat cheese. Sometimes I'll form it into a round
          patty shape and have it as a breakfast sandwich between a two slices of a 
          bagel or wrapped in a tortilla with hot sauce as a breakfast burrito.</p>
      <p>Use leftover ingredients as filling for this omelette and report back here when 
          you discover a really great (or really gross) combo.</p>
