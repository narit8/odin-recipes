    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I'll be honest, I prefer chicken thigh to chicken breast. Chicken breast is 
    harder to cook without it becoming dry and having that grainy, sand-like 
    texture that forms a dry ball as you chew it.</p>
    <p>The most important thing to remember when cooking chicken breast is not to over 
    cook it. I've found the air fryer to be the easiest, fastest, and most 
    consistent way to cook chicken breast. After much trial and error, here's my 
    recipe for juicy, well-seasoned chicken breast.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>chicken breast</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>pepper</li>
      <li>garlic powder</li>
      <li>onion powder</li>
      <li>paprika</li>
      <li>Special equipment: food thermometer</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut chicken breast into smaller chunks, they will cook faster and more evenly (optional)</li>
      <li>Season the chicken breast with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika and let it rest in the fridge for 0-24 hours (the longer the better but feel free to cook immediately if you don't have the time)</li>
      <li>Remove the chicken breast from the frudge and the meat come to room tempurature, this will reduce cooking time and result in a jucier breast (optional)</li>
      <li>Lay the chicken in your airfryer in a single layer with minimal touching to promote air flow and even cooking</li>
      <li>Cook the chicken breast at 375°F for 7-15 minutes or until it reaches 165°F, cooking time will vary grately based on the thickness of the chicken and how cold it is when you start cooking</li>
      <li>Remove the chicken from the air fryer and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before serving to allow for carry over cooking from the residual heat and to prevent the juices from leaking out</li>
    </ol>
