      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>I'll be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of chicken breast. Chicken thigh is 
      much easier to cook while breast meat easily transforms into a dry, grainy texture 
      that forms a ball in your mouth the longer chew it.</p>
      <p> But thats why this recipe is so important. After much trial and error, I've 
      finally found the best way to cook juicy, flavour chicken breast. The most 
      important thing to remember when cooking chicken breast is not to over cook it. 
      The best way I've found is to use the air fryer. Not only is it the easiest, and 
      most consistent way to cook chicken breast but its extremely fast. You can have 
      chicken ready in less than 15 minutes.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>chicken breast</li>
          <li>salt</li>
          <li>pepper</li>
          <li>garlic powder</li>
          <li>onion powder</li>
          <li>paprika</li>
          <li>Special equipment: food thermometer</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Cut the chicken breast into smaller chunks, they will cook faster and more evenly (optional)</li>
          <li>Season the chicken breast with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika and let it rest in the fridge for 0-24 hours (the longer the better but feel free to cook immediately if you don't have the time)</li>
          <li>Remove the chicken breast from the frudge and the meat come to room tempurature, this will reduce cooking time and result in a jucier breast (optional)</li>
          <li>Lay the chicken in your airfryer in a single layer with minimal touching to promote air flow and even cooking</li>
          <li>Cook the chicken breast at 375°F for 7-15 minutes or until it reaches 165°F, cooking time will vary grately based on the size and thickness of the chicken and how cold it is when you start cooking</li>
          <li>Remove the chicken from the air fryer and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before serving to allow for carry over cooking from the residual heat and to prevent the juices from leaking out</li>
      </ol>
