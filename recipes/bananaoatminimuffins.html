    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My Sunday morning ritual consists of coffee and a science experiment. I make a batch of these muffins 
        every weekend. Starting with the same base recipe I test various add-ins and toppings that change 
        the flavour and nutrition profile of these mini muffins. Peanut butter powder for extra protein and 
        fewer calories, dry milk powder for tenderness, bran for fiber, toasted bran for fiber and flavour. 
        Don't worry about exact measurements, use what you have and don't be afraid to make substitutions. 
        Just remember to be a conscientious scientist and return here to share your results, successes and 
        failures, we can all learn a thing or two from each other.

    <p>I love that this recipe uses normal oatmeal ingredients in muffin form. This is not a wheat muffin 
        with a hint of oatmeal added for texture. This is your breakfast oatmeal, minus the liquid, plus
        baking powder, blended and baked in a muffin tray. I keep these muffins in the freezer for quick 
        breakfasts and healthy snacks throughout the week.
